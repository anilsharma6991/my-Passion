BIKE RIDING
BIKE RIDING IS MY PASSION AND I LOVE TO RIDE BIKE EVERYTIME. SOME PEOPLE DO HANGOUT BUT I LOVE TO RIDE BIKE WHEN I AM ALONE. ITS RELAXATION FOR ME. ALSO I HAVE LOTS OF MEMORY WITH MY BIKE. IT IS LIKE AS MEDITATION WHEN I AM RIDING MY BIKE I FEEL FREE AND VERY RELAX. MOST OF TIME IN MORNING AND NIGHT I RIDING AND GO TO HANGOUT AND NIGHT OUT. I ALWAYS EXPLORE NEW PLACES WITH MY BIKE.
